sample averaging - ensures that those out of bounds will be disregaarded

Sx = LCD Resolution in X 
Sy = LCD Resolution in Y

Kx = scaled coordinates of X (display resolution divided by touch screen controller resolution)
Ky = scaled coordinates of Y (display resolution divided by touch screen controller resolution)
** Kx and Ky highly depends on the resolution of both the LCD & TSC **

X' = Touch Screen Controllers coordinates of X
Y' = Touch Screen Controllers coordinates of Y
